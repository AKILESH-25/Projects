# Face Recognition using PCA with ANN

This project implements a face recognition system using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for identity classification. Designed as part of an internship studio project, this work aims to optimize recognition accuracy while reducing feature dimensionality for faster and more efficient model inference.
